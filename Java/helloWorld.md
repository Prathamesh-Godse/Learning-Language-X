# Hello World!

## ✅ Code 

```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```

---

## 🧠 **Detailed Explanation – Line by Line**

---

### 🔹 `public class HelloWorld {`

- `class` → A **class** is the building block of Java programs.  
    It defines a **blueprint** from which objects are created.
    
- `HelloWorld` → This is the **name** of the class.
    
    - Must match the filename (`HelloWorld.java`) exactly.
        
    - Java is **case-sensitive**, so `helloworld` or `HELLOWORLD` would be considered different.
        
- `public` → This is an **access modifier**.
    
    - It means this class is **accessible from anywhere** in your program.
        
    - Without `public`, the class would only be accessible from inside its package.
        

> 🧠 Summary: You're defining a public class named `HelloWorld`. Java expects every application to have at least one class.

---

### 🔹 `public static void main(String[] args) {`

This is the **entry point** of any Java program.

Let’s break it into parts:

#### 🔸 `public`

- Makes the method accessible from **outside the class**.
    
- Required by Java so the runtime (JVM) can **find and run** it.
    

#### 🔸 `static`

- Means this method belongs to the **class**, not an object.
    
- You don't need to create an instance of `HelloWorld` to run `main`.
    

#### 🔸 `void`

- The method **returns nothing**.
    
- `void` means it completes its task (like printing), but **does not return a value**.
    

#### 🔸 `main`

- This is the **main method**.
    
- The **Java Virtual Machine (JVM)** looks for this method to start the program.
    

#### 🔸 `(String[] args)`

- The method accepts an **array of Strings** as input.
    
- These are **command-line arguments** passed when the program is run.
    
    - Example: `java HelloWorld foo bar`  
        → `args[0] = "foo"`  
        → `args[1] = "bar"`
        

> 🧠 Summary: This method is **static**, **public**, and **void** so the Java interpreter can run it directly without an object and without expecting a return value. It's where your program starts.

---

### 🔹 `System.out.println("Hello, World!");`

This line prints the message `"Hello, World!"` to the console.

#### Breaking it down:

- `System` → A **built-in class** in Java from the `java.lang` package.
    
    - It provides access to system-level utilities.
        
- `out` → A **static member** of `System`.
    
    - It's an object of class `PrintStream`.
        
    - Used to output text to the **console** (standard output).
        
- `println()` → A method of the `PrintStream` class.
    
    - It prints the given text and **adds a newline** after it.
        
- `"Hello, World!"` → A **String literal** — the message to be printed.
    

> 🧠 Summary: This line tells Java to **print text** to the screen and **move to the next line** afterward.

---

### 🔹 Closing Braces `}`

- These close the `main` method and the `HelloWorld` class.
    
- Every opening `{` must have a matching `}`.
    
- Java uses **braces to define blocks** of code.

## 🧾 Recap (for notes)

|Part|Explanation|
|---|---|
|`public class HelloWorld`|Declares a public class named `HelloWorld`|
|`public static void main(String[] args)`|Defines the entry point of the program|
|`System.out.println("Hello, World!");`|Prints the message to the screen with a newline|
|`{` and `}`|Define the beginning and end of class and method blocks|

## More

### **1. More on Access Modifiers**

Access modifiers control **who can see or use** a class, method, or variable.

|Modifier|Where it can be accessed from|
|---|---|
|`public`|From **anywhere** (other packages, files, classes)|
|`private`|Only from **within the same class**|
|`protected`|From the **same package** and subclasses (even outside)|
|_no modifier_|(called _package-private_) — from **same package only**|

> 🔹 Use `public` when others **need access**.  
> 🔹 Use `private` when you want to **hide details**.

---

### **2. What if no access modifier is used?**

That’s called **default access** or **package-private**.

- The class/member will only be accessible to other classes **within the same package**.
    
- It’s **less open** than `public`, but **more open** than `private`.
    

Example:

```java
class MyClass { }  // Not public → can only be used inside the same package
```

---

### **3. Can a method belong to an object?**

✅ **Yes.**

- Methods that are **not marked `static`** belong to an **object (instance)** of the class.
    
- You need to **create an object** to use them.
    

Example:

```java
class Dog {
    void bark() {
        System.out.println("Woof!");
    }
}

Dog d = new Dog();  // d is an object
d.bark();           // object method call
```

> 🔹 `static` methods belong to the **class itself**.  
> 🔹 Non-static methods belong to **objects (instances)**.

---

### **4. So even though `main` is inside a class, it doesn't need an instance?**

✅ **Correct!**

- Because `main` is marked `static`, it belongs to the **class**, not an object.
    
- The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) can run it directly without creating an instance.
    

> 🔹 That’s why we say:  
> “Static means no object needed.”

---

### **5. The `main` method is the only thing in the program. What is the `String[] args` it's accepting?**

- It’s a way to **receive input from the command line**.
    
- `args` is an **array of Strings** — it holds any text passed when you run the program.
    

Example:

```bash
java HelloWorld apple banana
```

Inside your Java code:

- `args[0]` is `"apple"`
    
- `args[1]` is `"banana"`
    

If you don’t pass anything, `args.length == 0`

> 🔹 You **don’t have to use** it, but it must be there (by convention).

---

### **6. Can I remove `String[] args` and keep brackets empty?**

❌ **No, not recommended.**

- The JVM expects the exact signature:
    
    ```java
    public static void main(String[] args)
    ```
    

If you write:

```java
public static void main() { ... }
```

It compiles, but **won’t run** as the starting point — you’ll get an error like:

> `Main method not found in class HelloWorld`

> ✅ You can ignore `args` inside the method, but **don't remove it**.

---

### **7. What is a "member"?**

A **member** is **anything declared inside a class**.

This includes:

- **Fields** (variables inside the class)
    
- **Methods**
    
- **Constructors**
    
- **Nested classes**
    

Example:

```java
class Car {
    int speed;         // member variable (field)
    void drive() { }   // member method
}
```

---

### **8. So is object, member, and instance one and the same?**

❌ **No — they are related but different:**

|Term|Meaning|
|---|---|
|**Class**|A blueprint for creating objects.|
|**Object**|A real thing made from a class (like a car built from a blueprint).|
|**Instance**|Another word for object — interchangeable in most contexts.|
|**Member**|Anything declared inside a class (field, method, etc).|

Example:

```java
class Car {
    int speed;        // member
    void drive() {}   // member
}

Car myCar = new Car();  // myCar is an object (or instance)
```

> ✅ You create **instances (objects)** of a class, which contain **members**.

---

### **9. Why are `private` and `protected` confusing? Let’s clarify them.**

#### 🔒 `private`

- **Accessible only within the same class**.
    
- Think of it as **"My eyes only"** — no one else can see it, not even subclasses or classes in the same package.
    

```java
class Animal {
    private String name = "Dog";

    private void speak() {
        System.out.println("Bark");
    }
}
```

You **cannot access** `name` or `speak()` from outside the `Animal` class.

---

#### 🛡️ `protected`

- **Accessible within the same package** **and** **in subclasses (even if they’re in different packages)**.
    
- Think of it as **"Family and subclasses only"**.
    

```java
package animals;

public class Animal {
    protected void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Animal sound");
    }
}
```

```java
package zoo;
import animals.Animal;

public class Dog extends Animal {
    void bark() {
        makeSound(); // ✅ allowed because it's a subclass
    }
}
```

---

### **10. What is Package-Private (Default Access)?**

- **When no modifier is used**, Java uses **package-private** access by default.
    
- It means: **Accessible only within the same package.**
    
- Not accessible from a different package, **even if it’s a subclass**.
    

```java
class Animal {
    void sleep() {
        System.out.println("Sleeping"); // package-private
    }
}
```

Other classes **in the same package** can use `sleep()`, but not those in other packages.

---

### **11. What are Fields, Methods, Constructors, and Nested Classes?**

#### 🧱 Fields

- Variables declared inside a class (but outside any method).
    
- Represent the **state/data** of an object.
    

```java
class Car {
    String color = "Red"; // Field
}
```

---

#### 🧠 Methods

- Code blocks that define behavior.
    
- Operate on the object’s data (fields).
    

```java
void drive() { // Method
    System.out.println("Driving");
}
```

---

#### 🏗️ Constructors

- Special methods used to **initialize** new objects.
    
- Same name as the class.
    
- No return type.
    

```java
class Car {
    Car() {
        System.out.println("Car created");
    }
}
```

---

#### 📦 Nested Classes

- Classes defined **within another class**.
    
- Useful for grouping related logic.
    

```java
class Outer {
    class Inner {
        void show() {
            System.out.println("Inner class");
        }
    }
}
```

---

### **12. Difference between Object and Instance**

- 🔹 **Instance**: The actual **runtime version** of a class.
    
- 🔹 **Object**: Technically the **same thing**, but more generally used to refer to anything created from a class.
    

```java
Car myCar = new Car(); 
// myCar is both an object and an instance of Car
```

> Think of:
> 
> - `Class` → Blueprint
>     
> - `Object`/`Instance` → House built from the blueprint
>     

🔸 **"Object" is the more general term**, whereas **"instance" is more often used when referring to a specific variable created from a class.**

---

### **13. So Java doesn't have functions?**

Correct — **Java does not have _free-standing_ functions** like in C or Python.

- **All functions must be inside a class**, and are called **methods**.
    
- Java is a **pure object-oriented language** (except for primitive types), so **everything lives in a class**.
    

```java
class Utility {
    static void printHello() {
        System.out.println("Hello");
    }
}
```

You **cannot** write a function like this in Java:

```java
// ❌ Not allowed in Java
void sayHi() {
    System.out.println("Hi");
}
```
